# Patientor frontend

### Getting started

- To get the app running just install its dependencies with `npm install` and run it with `npm run dev`.
- The app should work without a backend, but make sure that the request made to `/api/ping` made on startup is successful before continuing.
- The app is built with TypeScript and React, using Material-UI for the UI components.
